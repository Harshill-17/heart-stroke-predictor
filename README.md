## 📊 How It Works

1. **User Inputs**: Age, gender, chest pain, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
2. **Input Encoding**: Categorical features are one-hot encoded.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.
4. **Model Prediction**: KNN model provides a binary output:
   - 🔴 High Risk
   - 🟢 Low Risk
5. **Output Display**: Result shown instantly with styled feedback.
